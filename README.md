# Second-Year-Project
A project based upon a Raspberry Pi and a webcam. Needs to implement some sort of signal processing

We decided to try and implement an advertisement analytic system which would be mounted above an advertisement board. 
It would then analyse the number of people that walk past the board and keep a tally of the number of people who:
- Actively looked at the board and were interested
- Glanced at the board and moved on
- Walked past and didn't look at the board

To do this we realise we would need to implement machine learning and facial recognition. This would be needed to analyse the direction that people looked at in order to determine which way they were looking.
